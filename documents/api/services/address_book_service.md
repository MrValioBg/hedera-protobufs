### AddressBookService
Transactions for the AddressBook Service, those HAPI APIs facilitate changes to the nodes used across the Hedera network.
All those transactions needs to be signed by the Hedera Council. Steps needed below:
1. The node operator creates and signs the transaction with their key (the key on the node operator account)
2. The node operator hands this transaction to Alex, who then gives it to the council to sign
3. When signed and submitted, the server will verify that account 2 keys have signed, and the keys on the operator account have signed.
Hedera council should have ability to make all edits in addition to add/remove nodes
