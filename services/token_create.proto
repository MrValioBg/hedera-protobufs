/**
 * Create a new token. After the token is created, the Token ID for it is in the receipt.
 * The specified Treasury Account is receiving the initial supply of tokens as-well as the tokens
 * from the Token Mint operation once executed. The balance of the treasury account is decreased
 * when the Token Burn operation is executed.
 * 
 * The <tt>initialSupply</tt> is the initial supply of the smallest parts of a token (like a
 * tinybar, not an hbar). These are the smallest units of the token which may be transferred.
 * 
 * The supply can change over time. If the total supply at some moment is <i>S</i> parts of tokens,
 * and the token is using <i>D</i> decimals, then <i>S</i> must be less than or equal to
 * 2<sup>63</sup>-1, which is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. The number of whole tokens (not parts) will
 * be <i>S / 10<sup>D</sup></i>.
 * 
 * If decimals is 8 or 11, then the number of whole tokens can be at most a few billions or
 * millions, respectively. For example, it could match Bitcoin (21 million whole tokens with 8
 * decimals) or hbars (50 billion whole tokens with 8 decimals). It could even match Bitcoin with
 * milli-satoshis (21 million whole tokens with 11 decimals).
 * 
 * Note that a created token is <i>immutable</i> if the <tt>adminKey</tt> is omitted. No property of
 * an immutable token can ever change, with the sole exception of its expiry. Anyone can pay to
 * extend the expiry time of an immutable token.
 * 
 * A token can be either <i>FUNGIBLE_COMMON</i> or <i>NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE</i>, based on its
 * <i>TokenType</i>. If it has been omitted, <i>FUNGIBLE_COMMON</i> type is used.
 * 
 * A token can have either <i>INFINITE</i> or <i>FINITE</i> supply type, based on its
 * <i>TokenType</i>. If it has been omitted, <i>INFINITE</i> type is used.
 * 
 * If a <i>FUNGIBLE</i> TokenType is used, <i>initialSupply</i> should explicitly be set to a
 * non-negative. If not, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_TOKEN_INITIAL_SUPPLY.
 * 
 * If a <i>NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE</i> TokenType is used, <i>initialSupply</i> should explicitly be set
 * to 0. If not, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_TOKEN_INITIAL_SUPPLY.
 * 
 * If an <i>INFINITE</i> TokenSupplyType is used, <i>maxSupply</i> should explicitly be set to 0. If
 * it is not 0, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_TOKEN_MAX_SUPPLY.
 * 
 * If a <i>FINITE</i> TokenSupplyType is used, <i>maxSupply</i> should be explicitly set to a
 * non-negative value. If it is not, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_TOKEN_MAX_SUPPLY.
